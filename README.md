# 👋 Hi, I’m TheYuriG.
<img src="https://github-profile-summary-cards.vercel.app/api/cards/profile-details?username=TheYuriG&theme=radical"/>

Sometimes I make [blog posts](https://github.com/TheYuriG/blog_lessons/tree/master/discord_create_channels) teaching people to do things I consider myself good at, but most days I'm spending 10+ hours to get a project up and running, as if I was a 1-man startup.

I write code **every** single day, regardless of being weekend, holiday or my birthday because I really enjoy doing so. Few things in life compare to the feeling of writing code for 30 minutes and then having it run successfuly on the first attempt.

I'm mainly a Javascript/Node.JS developer, but I can write more-than-decent Dart code if I need to. Life finds a way.

Currently the only backend engineer responsible for [Trophy Place](https://trophy.place), but I eventually that staff should grow.
