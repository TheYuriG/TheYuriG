- I've built a JS [Discord bot](https://discordapp.com/invite/j55v7pD) that i've maintained alone since March 2019. It now has over 30 features that you can check at #bot_commands_list and test at #bot_usage. It's a very useful bot for Playstation trophy related data and it crawls and processes data from PSNProfiles.com using request and [cheerio](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cheerio) (uses syntax similar to JQuery). Feel free to message me here if you want to be shown around, if are not coming from a trophy hunting background and I'll happily show you the bot features. I also track issues, suggestions and the changelog in that same server, so you can scroll through those while you are at it.

- With Dart and Flutter, I've started a project to [port the bot](https://github.com/TheYuriG/Yura/tags) to Android and Windows, but the [project got bigger](https://trello.com/b/EK0M1sl8/yuras-development-board) (considering I was no longer limited by Discord) but it eventually came to a halt when Flutter 2.0 came out with null safety breaking my packages and my project when I changed computers. I still intend to go back to rebuild that project in the somewhat near future in Flutter 3.0, get a macbook and put the app on every existing platform since I would be covered in every enviroment and Yura app has a big focus on accessibility regardless of what ecossystem you use.

- I‚Äôm currently learning all of [NodeJS backend](https://www.udemy.com/course/nodejs-the-complete-guide/) at Udemy and it's a very fun course which I'm enjoying to do. Already went through the most basic and recently went through authentication, sessions and how to stop CSRF attacks.

- Future plan is to start the [Responsive Web Design Certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design) at FreeCodeCamp, then circle back at Flutter (improving on my foundations), React Native (because it's such a hot framework at the moment) and Typescript (to use the strongly typed language that I got used to in Dart in Javascript).

Since May 2021, I've been working full time as an Offline Media Advertising Analyst (since I have a Bachelor Degree in Marketing and Advertising) and since May 2022 study coding at every possible free minute (every week night after work, plus all day on weekends. Check the graph above or the activity graph below), but looking forward to make the switch to tech as Software Developer abroad on either frontend (building web/mobile apps) or backend (building APIs or data processing). I'm obsessed about learning more every day, because I love to see the world opening up as I learn new ways to do old and new things.

Feel free to suggest more important books, but do beware that I spend most of my time coding instead of reading, so going through a book is a months-long process.
