- üëã Hi, I‚Äôm @TheYuriG.
- I code in Javascript (backend) and Dart (fullstack with Flutter + Hive). Future plan is to add React to my arsenal of languages.
- With JS, I've built a [Discord bot](https://discordapp.com/invite/j55v7pD) that i've maintained alone since March 2019. With Dart and Flutter, I've started a project to [port the bot](https://github.com/TheYuriG/Yura/tags) to Android and Windows, but the [project got bigger](https://trello.com/b/EK0M1sl8/yuras-development-board) (considering I was no longer limited by Discord) but it eventually came to a halt when Flutter 2.0 came out with null safety breaking my packages and my project when I changed computers. I still intend to go back to rebuild that project in the somewhat near future in Flutter 3.0 and put the app on the Google Play Store as a side project.
- I‚Äôm currently learning all of [NodeJS backend](https://www.udemy.com/course/nodejs-the-complete-guide/) at Udemy and it's a very fun course which I'm enjoying to do.
- Future plan is to start the [Responsive Web Design Certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design) at FreeCodeCamp, then circle back at Flutter (improving on my foundations), React Native (because it's such a hot framework at the moment) and Typescript (to use the strongly typed language of Dart in Javascript).

As of June 2022, I'm working full time as an Offline Media Advertising Analyst (since I have a Bachelor Degree in Marketing and Advertising) and study coding on week nights (every night, after work. Check the graph above that testifies for my dedication) and weekends (when I have the most free time), but looking forward to make the switch to tech as Software Developer abroad on either frontend (building apps) or backend (building APIs or data processing). I'm really obsessed about learning more and more, as I love to see the world opening up to me as I learn new ways to do old and new things.

Books I am reading/have read:
- [Atomic Habits](https://www.amazon.com/Atomic-Habits-James-Clear-audiobook/dp/B07RFSSYBH/) by James Clear.
- [Clean Architecture](https://www.amazon.com/Clean-Architecture-Craftsmans-Software-Structure/dp/B08X8H5G2J/) by Robert C. Martin.
- [Design Patterns](https://www.amazon.com/Design-Patterns-Elements-Reusable-Object-Oriented/dp/0201633612) by Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson, John Vlissides
- [Scrum](https://www.amazon.com/Scrum-Doing-Twice-Work-Half/dp/038534645X) by Jeff Sutherland.
- [Doing AGILE Right](https://www.amazon.com/Doing-Agile-Right-Transformation-Without/dp/163369870X) by Darrell Rigby, Sarah Elk, Steve Berez.

Feel free to suggest more important books, but do beware that I spend most of my time coding instead of reading, so going through a book is a months-long process.
