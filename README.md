- üëã Hi, I‚Äôm @TheYuriG.
- I code in Javascript (backend) and Dart (fullstack with Flutter + Hive). Future plan is to add React to my arsenal of languages.
- With JS, I've built a [Discord bot](https://discordapp.com/invite/j55v7pD) that i've maintained alone since March 2019. With Dart and Flutter, I've started a project to [port the bot](https://github.com/TheYuriG/Yura/tags) to Android and Windows, but the [project got bigger](https://trello.com/b/EK0M1sl8/yuras-development-board) (considering I was no longer limited by Discord) but it eventually came to a halt when Flutter 2.0 came out with null safety breaking my packages and my project when I changed computers. I still intend to go back to rebuild that project in the somewhat near future in Flutter 3.0 and put the app on the Google Play Store as a side project.
- I‚Äôm currently learning all of [NodeJS backend](https://www.udemy.com/course/nodejs-the-complete-guide/) at Udemy and it's a very fun course which I'm enjoying to do.
- Future plan is to start the [Responsive Web Design Certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design) at FreeCodeCamp, then circle back at Flutter (improving on my foundations), React Native (because it's such a hot framework at the moment) and Typescript (to use the strongly typed language that I got used to in Dart in Javascript).

Since May 2021, I've been working full time as an Offline Media Advertising Analyst (since I have a Bachelor Degree in Marketing and Advertising) and since May 2022 study coding at every possible free minute (every week night after work, plus all day on weekends. Check the graph above or the activity graph below), but looking forward to make the switch to tech as Software Developer abroad on either frontend (building web/mobile apps) or backend (building APIs or data processing). I'm obsessed about learning more every day, because I love to see the world opening up as I learn new ways to do old and new things.

Feel free to suggest more important books, but do beware that I spend most of my time coding instead of reading, so going through a book is a months-long process.
