- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @TheYuriG.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in <img src="{https://img.shields.io/badge/JavaScript-323330?style=for-the-badge&logo=javascript&logoColor=F7DF1E" /> and <img src="{https://img.shields.io/badge/Dart-0175C2?style=for-the-badge&logo=dart&logoColor=white" />.
- With JS, I've built a [Discord bot](https://discordapp.com/invite/j55v7pD) that i've maintainned alone since March 2019. With Dart and Flutter, I've started a project to [port the bot](https://github.com/TheYuriG/Yura/tags) to Android and Windows, but the project got bigger and bigger (considering I was no longer limited by Discord) but it eventually came to a halt when Flutter 2.0 came out with null safety breaking my packages and my project. I still intend to go back to rebuild that project in the somewhat near future in Flutter 3.0 and put the app on the Google Play Store as a side business, but time will tell.
- Regarding work tools, I've had quite a bit of experience with these: <img src="{https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-100000?style=for-the-badge&logo=github&logoColor=white" /> <img src="{https://img.shields.io/badge/Jira-0052CC?style=for-the-badge&logo=Jira&logoColor=white" /> <img src="{https://img.shields.io/badge/Figma-F24E1E?style=for-the-badge&logo=figma&logoColor=white" /> <img src="{https://img.shields.io/badge/Raspberry%20Pi-A22846?style=for-the-badge&logo=Raspberry%20Pi&logoColor=white" /> <img src="{https://img.shields.io/badge/Google%20Sheets-34A853?style=for-the-badge&logo=google-sheets&logoColor=white" /> <img src="{https://img.shields.io/badge/Notion-000000?style=for-the-badge&logo=notion&logoColor=white" /> <img src="{https://img.shields.io/badge/Trello-0052CC?style=for-the-badge&logo=trello&logoColor=white" />.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning all of <img src="{https://img.shields.io/badge/Node.js-339933?style=for-the-badge&logo=nodedotjs&logoColor=white" /> at <img src="{https://img.shields.io/badge/Udemy-EC5252?style=for-the-badge&logo=Udemy&logoColor=white" />.
- Future plan is to start the [Responsive Web Design Certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design) at <img src="{https://img.shields.io/badge/freecodecamp-27273D?style=for-the-badge&logo=freecodecamp&logoColor=white" />, then circle back at <img src="{https://img.shields.io/badge/Flutter-02569B?style=for-the-badge&logo=flutter&logoColor=white" /> and then progress into <img src="{https://img.shields.io/badge/React_Native-20232A?style=for-the-badge&logo=react&logoColor=61DAFB" /> and <img src="{https://img.shields.io/badge/TypeScript-007ACC?style=for-the-badge&logo=typescript&logoColor=white" />.

As of June 2022, I'm working full time as an Offline Media Advertising Analyst and study coding at night, but looking forward to make the switch to tech as Software Developer abroad on either frontend (building apps) or backend (building APIs or data processing).
