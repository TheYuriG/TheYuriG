- üëã Hi, I‚Äôm @TheYuriG.
- I code in Javascript (backend) and Dart (fullstack with Flutter + Hive).
- With JS, I've built a [Discord bot](https://discordapp.com/invite/j55v7pD) that i've maintainned alone since March 2019. With Dart and Flutter, I've started a project to [port the bot](https://github.com/TheYuriG/Yura/tags) to Android and Windows, but the project got bigger and bigger (considering I was no longer limited by Discord) but it eventually came to a halt when Flutter 2.0 came out with null safety breaking my packages and my project. I still intend to go back to rebuild that project in the somewhat near future in Flutter 3.0 and put the app on the Google Play Store as a side project, but time will tell.
- I‚Äôm currently learning all of NodeJS at Udemy.
- Future plan is to start the [Responsive Web Design Certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design) at FreeCodeCamp, then circle back at Flutter and React Native and Typescript.

As of June 2022, I'm working full time as an Offline Media Advertising Analyst and study coding at night, but looking forward to make the switch to tech as Software Developer abroad on either frontend (building apps) or backend (building APIs or data processing).
