# üëã Hi, I‚Äôm TheYuriG.
<img src="https://github-profile-summary-cards.vercel.app/api/cards/profile-details?username=TheYuriG&theme=radical"/>

When I'm not freelancing to pay my bills, I'm either [blogging](https://www.theyurig.com/blog), contributing to [Deno's Fresh](https://github.com/denoland/fresh), or building some of my hobby projects (listed below).

I'm always writing code, **every** single day, be it a weekend, holiday, or my birthday. I'm that passionate about it. Few things in life compare to the feeling of writing code for 30 minutes and then having all tests pass on the first attempt.

I'm mostly a Typescript/Deno developer, but I can write more-than-decent Dart code if I need to. Life finds a way.

There is a minimal list of the projects I'm usually working on at any given time:
- [Trophy Place](https://my.trophy.place) (Backend and Mobile Engineer)
- [Tic Tac Toe Multiplayer](https://tictactoe.deno.dev/) (Full Stack)
- [My personal website](https://www.theyurig.com/) (mostly Frontend Engineer)
- [Prizewinner](https://github.com/trophy-place/prizewinner) (Lead, Backend Engineer)

These are the technologies I am comfortable working with, right now:
Preact, Vue 3, Fresh, Nuxt 3, DenoKV, Mongo/Mongoose, Express, Oak, Cheetah, Auth0/JWT.

And these are the ones I've used extensively before, but haven't used in at least 3 months:
React, React Router, React Toolkit, NextJS, Handlebars, EJS, Pug/Jade, jQuery, MySQL, Postgres, Prisma, Docker (and probably many more that I can't recall right now).
